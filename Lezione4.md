# Introduction to Electrical Circuits üöÄ

Welcome to today's lecture on electrical circuits! We'll dive into the basics of current, potential, and simple electrical circuits. Feel free to ask questions, and if you prefer not to be recorded, just let me know. Let's get started!

## Electric Current and Conventions ‚ö°

### Definition of Electric Current
Electric current is the flow of electric charge, typically confined within circuits made of conductive materials like wires. This flow requires conductive materials, allowing various configurations and models of electrical circuits.

### Circuit Types
1. **Direct Current (DC):**
   - The current flows consistently in one direction.
   - It involves a generator that propels the current from the positive to the negative side, following conventional flow from positive to negative.

2. **Alternating Current (AC):**
   - The current changes direction periodically.
   - The generator in an AC circuit doesn't maintain a fixed polarity, allowing the current to alternate directions.

### Current Intensity
The current intensity, \( I \), is defined as the rate of charge flow through a cross-section of the wire:
\[ I = \frac{dQ}{dt} \]
where \( Q \) is the charge and \( t \) is the time.

## Microscopic View of Current Flow üîç

### Charge Carriers
- The flow of current is due to charge carriers, typically electrons in conductors.
- The average drift velocity of these charge carriers is quite small.

### Mathematical Representation
The current can be expressed as:
\[ I = n \cdot A \cdot v_d \cdot e \]
where:
- \( n \) is the charge carrier density,
- \( A \) is the cross-sectional area of the wire,
- \( v_d \) is the drift velocity,
- \( e \) is the elementary charge.

## Resistance and Ohm's Law üîå

### Ohmic Conductors
- The relationship between voltage \( V \) and current \( I \) is linear:
  \[ V = I \cdot R \]
  where \( R \) is the resistance.

### Resistance Factors
- Resistance depends on the material's resistivity \( \rho \), length \( L \), and cross-sectional area \( A \):
  \[ R = \rho \cdot \frac{L}{A} \]

### Power Dissipation
The power \( P \) dissipated in a resistor is given by:
\[ P = I^2 \cdot R = V^2 / R \]

## Circuit Analysis Techniques üîÑ

### Series and Parallel Circuits
1. **Series Circuits:**
   - Total resistance: \( R_{\text{total}} = R_1 + R_2 + \ldots + R_n \)
   - Same current flows through each component.

2. **Parallel Circuits:**
   - Total resistance: \( \frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \ldots + \frac{1}{R_n} \)
   - Same voltage across each component.

### Kirchhoff's Laws
1. **Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL):**
   - The sum of all voltages around a closed loop is zero.

2. **Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL):**
   - The sum of currents entering a junction equals the sum of currents leaving the junction.

## Capacitors and Energy Storage üîã

### Capacitors in Circuits
- Capacitors store energy in an electric field between two plates.
- The charge \( Q \) on a capacitor is given by:
  \[ Q = C \cdot V \]
  where \( C \) is the capacitance.

### Charging and Discharging
- **Charging:** The voltage across a capacitor increases as it stores charge.
- **Discharging:** The stored energy is released, causing the voltage to decrease.

### Time Constant
- The time constant \( \tau \) for a resistor-capacitor (RC) circuit is given by:
  \[ \tau = R \cdot C \]
  It indicates how quickly a capacitor charges or discharges.

## Advanced Concepts and Applications üåü

### AC Circuits and Filters
- Capacitors can be used to filter signals, allowing only certain frequencies to pass through.
- **High-pass filters** allow high-frequency signals while blocking low-frequency ones.

### Real-world Applications
- Electrical circuits are foundational in household wiring, electronic devices, and more.
- Understanding circuit behavior helps in designing efficient systems.
